<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Competitive Programmer || Kaggle expert || Full-Stack developer || Data Science and Artificial Intelligence @IIIT.</p>

<p>I have a keen curiosity about the origin and development of computers. The clock cycle ticks me. I consider myself a problem-solving geek but also interested in software development. Evolution of Intelligence and Automation keeps me awake. I want to learn and implement the working of CS fields from the ground up and then move to the framework because beauty lies in origin. Also, a Mathematics Lover.
  I plan my days to maintain a balance between sports, literary works and coding and it is my belief that advancements in any one of them translates to progress in all of the other domains.
  I enjoy interacting with people with different experiences from mine.</p>
